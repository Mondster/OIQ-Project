# OIQ-Project

# SecOps Security Analytics Tech Challenge - DevOps Focus

## Scenario

You have been tasked to support a project aimed at rolling out logging agents to a wide set of server endpoints and building a new syslog collection infrastructure. Your role is as a **DevOps Engineer**, responsible for the infrastructure layer of this solution.

### Application Requirements

The application should include the following functionalities:

- Collect system logs from multiple data centres and centralize these at a single point before forwarding them to a downstream consumer.
- Provide a management server capable of communicating with all agents on the endpoints to push configuration and filtering changes. The management server must also be accessible via a UI.
- Support upstream sources located in physical data centres, either as hardware or virtual machines.
- Support downstream consumers hosted in the cloud as SaaS solutions. These solutions can utilize proprietary forwarders hosted as virtual appliances or webhook-like ingestion functionality.

Your deliverable is a design to support the above requirements.

## Considerations

While working on this solution, the following factors should be considered:

- **Scalability** and **cost efficiency**.
- **Stability** and **resilience**.
- **Patching** and **maintenance** strategies.
- The **technologies** used for hosting and building the solution.
- Any **assumptions** made during the design process.

## Response Format

You may choose to provide your solution in one of the following formats:

- A simplified solution built in a personal lab environment and demonstrated.
- A design diagram detailing the architecture, with the ability to discuss design decisions.
- A write-up detailing the design and approach, with a readiness to explain the decisions made.


The presence of a **web UI** for managing agents and collectors introduces an additional layer of complexity, especially when you’re managing the infrastructure and data collection simultaneously. Here’s how you can think about separating these concerns into different tiers:

### **Agent and Collector Management (Control Plane)**
- This is more of a **management layer** or **control plane** where the **web UI** manages the agents, pipelines, and configurations. It doesn’t directly handle the logs but ensures that the infrastructure is configured and running correctly.
  
### **Log Data Flow (Data Plane)**
- This part of the architecture focuses on the **data collection, processing, and forwarding** of logs, metrics, and traces from the agents to the central collector and finally to downstream systems.

### **Should You Have Separate Tiers for Data Flow and Agent Management?**

Yes, separating the tiers for **data flow** and **agent management** makes sense because they serve two different purposes:

1. **Data Plane (Log Collection & Processing)**: 
   - This layer involves the collection, processing, and forwarding of logs, metrics, and traces.
   - It would follow a **3-tier architecture** as discussed earlier:
     - **Tier 1 (Client):** OTel agents on endpoints.
     - **Tier 2 (Application Layer):** Local gateways for processing.
     - **Tier 3 (Data Layer):** Central collector for final aggregation and forwarding.
   
2. **Control Plane (Agent & Pipeline Management)**: 
   - This layer handles the **management of agents and pipelines**, such as updating agents, configuring log pipelines, and monitoring their health.
   - A **2-tier architecture** is suitable here:
     - **Tier 1 (Client/UI Layer):** The **Web UI** for the control plane where administrators configure and manage agents and collectors.
     - **Tier 2 (Management Layer):** A backend management server (e.g., **BindPlane** or **ObservIQ**) that communicates with the agents and local gateways to push configuration changes, monitor agent health, and manage updates.

### **Design Overview**

#### **1. Log Collection Data Flow (3-Tier Architecture - Data Plane)**
- **Tier 1 (Client):** OTel agents collect logs and metrics.
- **Tier 2 (Application):** Local gateways for filtering, batching, and forwarding the data.
- **Tier 3 (Data):** Central collector processes the logs and forwards them to downstream consumers (e.g., Prometheus, SIEM, etc.).

#### **2. Agent and Collector Management (2-Tier Architecture - Control Plane)**
- **Tier 1 (Client/UI):** The **Web UI** for managing the agents and pipelines.
- **Tier 2 (Management Server):** A backend server (**BindPlane**, **ObservIQ**, or similar) that handles agent configurations, updates, and health monitoring.

### **Why Separate the Two Architectures?**

1. **Different Responsibilities:**
   - The **Data Plane** focuses on collecting and processing large amounts of log data efficiently and reliably.
   - The **Control Plane** ensures that agents and infrastructure components are properly managed and functioning, without directly interacting with the log data itself.

2. **Scalability:**
   - The **Data Plane** may require high scalability to process vast amounts of logs and metrics, whereas the **Control Plane** only needs to scale to manage agent configurations and updates.

3. **Failure Isolation:**
   - By separating the two architectures, you ensure that if there’s an issue in the **Data Plane** (e.g., log processing), it doesn’t affect the ability to manage or monitor the agents via the **Control Plane**.

4. **Simplicity and Maintenance:**
   - The **Control Plane** (2-tier) remains relatively simple, focusing on configurations and updates.
   - The **Data Plane** (3-tier) can focus purely on scaling log collection and processing.

---

### **Example Setup:**

- **Agent and Pipeline Management (Control Plane):**
  - **Web UI:** A dashboard for managing agent deployments, configurations, and updates.
  - **Management Server:** Handles communication with the agents and gateways (e.g., BindPlane or ObservIQ).

- **Log Collection and Processing (Data Plane):**
  - **OTel Agents:** Deployed on endpoints to collect data.
  - **Local Gateways:** In each data center to pre-process and filter logs.
  - **Central Collector:** Collects the logs, processes them, and forwards them to downstream consumers (e.g., SIEM, Prometheus).

By using **two separate architectures** (2-tier for management and 3-tier for data flow), you maintain flexibility and scalability, ensuring that each part of the system can be independently scaled, monitored, and managed.
